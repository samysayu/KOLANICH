My nickname is `KOLANICH`, it is an uppercase (and shouldn't be downcased or capitalized) of a kinda transliteration of the Russian word `Коляныч` and is pronounced as `/koˌlʲaˌnɨt͡ɕʲ/`. It is derived from `Колян`, which is a variant of `Коля` (usually transliterated as `Kolya`) which is a diminutive of `Николай` (`Nikolay`), which English analogue is `Nick`.

I'm not a "sir": I have never been knighted, and I think that it is completely inacceptable to be a part of any feudal system.
